# Caffe for Deep Shading

This is a modified version of the [Caffe deep learning framework](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) to be used for working with the networks presented in our [Deep Shading paper](http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~onalbach/DeepShading/).

## Features

This modification is based on the official Caffe source of Aug 10, 2016.
It contains two additional loss layers (L1 and SSIM-based loss) and enables the use of image sets in the EXR format.
